# matplotlib-challenge
This is my submission for the module 5 challenge.

In my script I have included the following:
1. Analysis of data at the top of the notebook
2. Preparation of the data, which included created a single merged dataframe without any duplicates
3. A summary statistics dataframe
4. Bar and pie charts using pandas and matplotlib
5. Quartiles and outliers using a for loop and by creating a new dataframe with the 4 most promising drugs and a box plot of those drugs and final tumor volumes.
6. A line plot for one mouse and a scatter plot for tumor volumes and mice weight, both treated with Capomulin.
7. Calculation of correlation and regression between tumor volumes and mice weight of mice treated with Capomulin.
